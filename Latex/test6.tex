对 \LaTeX 的认识\\
LaTex is a tex-based typesetting system with functions similar to that of word, but using it to write papers is a completely new experience:
- complex tables and mathematical formulas can be generated in code;
- more beautiful layout;
- format can be unified control, eliminating the problem of continuous format adjustment;
-latex can preserve the whole writing process, while word can only retain the final result (flexible use of annotations);
- automatic batch generation of references;
- Linux support excellent;
- open source;
- many magazines only accept LaTex manuscripts;
Writing a paper is like writing a program.Complex formulas, charts and code generated by tapping, also support comments, too cool.
